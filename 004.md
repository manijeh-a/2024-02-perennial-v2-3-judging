# Exploitable Flaw in `transferOwnership` Function

## Summary
The `transferOwnership` function inherited from the Ownable contract within the `ProxyOwner` contract lacks proper access control, allowing any account to call it and transfer ownership without adhering to the intended two-step ownership transfer mechanism.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferOwnership` function overrides the same function from both the Ownable and Ownable2Step contracts without implementing the necessary access control checks to enforce the two-step ownership transfer process. This function is meant to transfer ownership of the contract, but it does so without requiring confirmation from both the current owner and the new owner, as per the two-step mechanism implemented elsewhere in the contract. As a result, any account can call this function and become the new owner without following the intended security protocol.
```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public override(Ownable, Ownable2Step) {
    super.transferOwnership(newOwner);
}
```

## Impact
The lack of proper access control in the `transferOwnership` function undermines the security measures intended to protect ownership transfer within the contract. This vulnerability allows unauthorized parties to take over ownership of the contract, potentially leading to malicious actions or unauthorized modifications to critical contract functionality.

## Recommendation
It's essential to override the `transferOwnership` function in the `ProxyOwner` contract and enforce the two-step ownership transfer mechanism.
