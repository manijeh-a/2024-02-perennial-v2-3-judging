# In `MultiInvoker.sol::invoke` transfer will not be compatible with some wallets

## Summary
The transfer function used in [`invoke`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perennial-v2-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L163) won't be compatible with multi-Sig wallets & smart contract wallets.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the last line of the [`invoke`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perennial-v2-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L163) we can see remaining balance of contract is being sent to `msg.sender` with `transfer`, this is a concern because some wallets like a multi-sig wallet use more than 2300 gas so transfer wont work on those wallets leading to a revert
## Impact
the transfer will revert whenever sending to any wallet that consumes more than 2300 gas
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function invoke(Invocation[] calldata invocations) external payable {
      
       ...
            
        // Eth must not remain in this contract at rest
@-->        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Another method that takes into consideration all the types of wallet should be used.
