# Use call instead of transfer on payable addresses

## Summary

In Solidity, when transferring Ether, .transfer() and .send() are commonly used. However, they have a limitation: they forward only a stipend of 2300 gas, which isn't enough to execute any code in the recipient contract beyond a simple event emission. Thus, if the recipient is a contract, the transfer may fail unexpectedly.

## Vulnerability Detail

To overcome this, Solidity introduced the .call{value: _amount}("") method, which forwards all available gas and can invoke more complex functionality. It's also safer in that it does not revert on failure but instead returns a boolean value to indicate success or failure. Therefore, it is generally a better choice to use .call when transferring Ether to a payable address, with the necessary safety checks implemented to handle potential errors.

## Impact

The transfer may fail unexpectedly.

```solidity
        // Eth must not remain in this contract at rest
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider replacing instances of .transfer() with .call() such as:

```solidity
(bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed");
```
