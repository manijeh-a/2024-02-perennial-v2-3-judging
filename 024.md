# In `MultiInvoker.sol::_withdraw` Blacklisted USDC addresses can lead to DOS

## Summary
In `MultiInvoker.sol::_withdraw` we can see the function unwraps DSU into USDC and pushes USDC amount to account without any checks on the account or any handling of reverts
## Vulnerability Detail
The [`_withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perennial-v2-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L274-L280) function is being used in a lot of functions such as [`_vaultUpdate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perennial-v2-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L208-L231) and [`_update`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perennial-v2-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L176-L200) to update state automatically for the account. 
As we know USDC has the blacklist functionality to prevent some addresses from performing transactions,
In the case where an address is being blacklisted the transaction will always revert leading to DOS and not able to retrieve funds
## Impact
This revert will affect the functionalitiy of the `_vaultUpdate`, `_update` and  the main function that's the [`invoke`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perennial-v2-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L115-L165)

```solidity
    function _withdraw(address account, UFixed6 amount, bool wrap) internal {
        if (wrap) {
            _unwrap(account, UFixed18Lib.from(amount));
        } else {
            DSU.push(account, UFixed18Lib.from(amount));
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The current implementation uses a "push" approach where usdc is sent to the recipient during every update, which introduces additional attack surfaces that the attackers can exploit.

Consider adopting a pull method for users to claim their amount.
