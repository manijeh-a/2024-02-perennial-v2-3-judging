# Uncontrolled Registry in MarketFactory.sol

## Summary

A vulnerability lies in the function `create`, whereby a new market is created. The control over the registry of markets is not enforced effectively. 


## Vulnerability Detail

When the market is created, there is only a check for the instance of the oracle and if a market already exists for that particular oracle alone. There is no control over who can register a new oracle-provider market pair in the `_markets` mapping. This functionality should ideally be limited to trusted parties (like the owner of the contract) to prevent misuse.



## Impact

In the event that an attacker can register a malicious oracle-provider market pair, they can potentially manipulate the newly created market's behaviours (oracle prices, etc.), which will affect all operations related to that market.

## Code Snippet

The affected code snippet is in the `create` function.
```solidity
newMarket = IMarket(address(_create(abi.encodeCall(IMarket.initialize, (definition)))));
_markets[definition.oracle][address(0)] = newMarket;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommended fix is to add an authorization check within the `create` function that prevents any untrusted party from adding a new `oracleProvider and market` pair to the `_markets` mapping. Typically, this kind of operation should only be performed by the contract's owner or any other trusted entity.
