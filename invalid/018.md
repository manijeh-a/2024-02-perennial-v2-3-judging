# In `Vault.sol::update` USDC blacklists can lead to locked up funds

## Summary
When pushing assets to the receiver the protocol doesn't check whether receiver is blacklisted or not & this can lead to lock up of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Vault.sol::update` the function updates the accounts position by socializing, updating positions & managing. 
in the [manage code block ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-02-perennial-v2-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L314-L319)of the same function, we can see that the `claimAmount` is being pushed or sent to the receiver(i.e msg.sender). And there's no implementation to check whether receiver is blacklisted or not, as a result this can lead to a revert causing the lock up of funds.


## Impact
This can lead to lock up of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The current implementation uses a "push" approach where reward tokens are sent to the recipient during every update, which introduces additional attack surfaces that the attackers can exploit.

Consider adopting a  method for users to claim their rewards instead so that the transfer of reward tokens is disconnected from the updating of reward balances.
