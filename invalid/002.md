# Division by Zero Vulnerability in `MetaQuantsFactory` Contract

## Summary
see below
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises in the `MetaQuantsFactory` contract within the `_parsePrices` function, specifically in the computation of the price when the exponent is less than zero. In this scenario, the code attempts to calculate `significand.div(base)`, which can lead to a division by zero error.


## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is a potential runtime error due to division by zero. If the exponent is less than zero, indicating that base is larger than `significand`, attempting to execute `significand.div(base)` will result in a division by zero error. This error can cause the contract transaction to revert, disrupting the intended functionality and potentially leading to loss of gas fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that division by zero does not occur. This can be achieved by verifying whether base is zero or non-zero before executing the division operation.
